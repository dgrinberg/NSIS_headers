## DotNetVer.nsh

A LogicLib extension that makes testing for the different versions of Microsoft.NET simple. 

It provides the functions for checking what versions are installed, if any.  It does not provide any functions for installing the framework.


## MdacVer.nsh

A LogicLib extension that makes testing, for the different versions of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC), simple.

As with DotNetVer, this header only provides functions for checking for the installed version.  It does not contain any functions for installing MDAC.
